# socialNetworkAPI

## Description

- I wanted to create a back end api for a social network application where people can create users, share posts(thoughts), react to posts, and add friends.
- This project was built to show my ability to use mongo/mongoose in a back end application.
- Having all of the back end routes set up and working successfully will make connecting to a front end application much more streamline. 
- I learned the similarities and differences between the strictness of SQL and the contrasting use of mongo/mongoose.
